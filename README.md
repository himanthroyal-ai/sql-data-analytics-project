# sql-data-analytics-project
A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. 
These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. 
Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This phase focuses on understanding the data through basic queries and aggregations.
It involves:Data Profiling: Examining the characteristics of the data.
Dimension and Measure Identification: Differentiating between dimensions (categorical data like Category, Products, Birthdate, ID) and measures (numeric data that can be aggregated like Sales, Quantity, Age).    
* Data Exploration: Analyzing the range and distribution of dates and the magnitude of measures.
Date Exploration: Finding the minimum and maximum dates, and the date difference using functions like DATEDIFF.
Measures Exploration: Calculating aggregations like SUM, AVG, and COUNT to understand the data's scale.


*Advanced Data Analytics: This final phase uses complex queries to answer specific business questions and create reports. This involves several types of analysis:
Aggregate Analysis: Calculating measures by dimensions, such as Total Sales by Country or Average Price by Product.
Trend Analysis: Tracking changes over time, for example, Total Sales by Year.     * 
Cumulative Analysis: Calculating running totals or moving averages. 

Window functions are key to this analysis.     
* Performance Analysis: Comparing a current measure against a target or a previous period, such as Current Sales vs. Average Sales or Current Year Sales vs. Previous Year Sales. This also uses 
  window functions.
Proportional Analysis: Calculating the percentage of a part to the whole, such as (Sales / Total Sales) * 100 by category.
Data Segmentation: Categorizing data into groups, like segmenting customers by age or products by sales range using a CASE WHEN statement
